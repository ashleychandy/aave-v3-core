# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the AAVE v3 protocol on the XDC Network Apothem testnet. The deployment will include all core protocol contracts, configuration for XDC-specific parameters, and integration with XDC Network's infrastructure including price feeds and test tokens.

## Glossary

- **AAVE Protocol**: A decentralized lending and borrowing protocol
- **XDC Network**: An enterprise-ready hybrid blockchain platform
- **Apothem**: The testnet environment for XDC Network
- **Deployment System**: The Hardhat-based deployment infrastructure that deploys and configures AAVE v3 contracts
- **Price Oracle**: A contract that provides asset price data from external sources
- **Pool Contract**: The main AAVE contract that handles lending, borrowing, and liquidity operations
- **Configuration Manager**: The system component responsible for network-specific settings

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to configure the Hardhat deployment system for XDC Apothem, so that I can deploy contracts to the correct network with proper credentials

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Hardhat configuration is loaded, THE Deployment System SHALL include an XDC Apothem network configuration with RPC URL "https://erpc.apothem.network"
2. WHEN deploying to XDC Apothem, THE Deployment System SHALL use the provided private key for transaction signing
3. WHEN the network configuration is accessed, THE Deployment System SHALL provide the correct chain ID for XDC Apothem (51)
4. THE Deployment System SHALL set appropriate gas price and gas limit parameters for XDC Network compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to deploy all core AAVE v3 contracts to XDC Apothem, so that the protocol is fully operational on the network

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment script executes, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy the PoolAddressesProvider contract
2. WHEN the PoolAddressesProvider is deployed, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy the Pool contract and register it with the provider
3. WHEN core contracts are deployed, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy the PoolConfigurator contract
4. WHEN tokenization is required, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy AToken, StableDebtToken, and VariableDebtToken implementations
5. WHEN all core contracts are deployed, THE Deployment System SHALL verify that each contract deployment transaction is confirmed on XDC Apothem

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to configure price oracles for XDC Network assets, so that the protocol can accurately value collateral and debt

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring price feeds, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy the AaveOracle contract
2. WHEN the XDC/USDT price feed address is available, THE Deployment System SHALL register the price feed at address "0x7D276a421fa99B0E86aC3B5c47205987De76B497" for the XDC/USDT pair
3. WHEN price sources are configured, THE Deployment System SHALL set fallback oracle mechanisms for asset price discovery
4. WHEN the oracle is deployed, THE Deployment System SHALL verify price feed accessibility and data validity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to configure test tokens (USDT and WXDC) as reserves in the protocol, so that users can interact with the lending pool

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test tokens are needed, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy or reference the Test_USDT contract
2. WHEN wrapped XDC is needed, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy or reference the Test_WXDC contract
3. WHEN reserves are initialized, THE Deployment System SHALL call the PoolConfigurator to add USDT as a reserve with appropriate parameters
4. WHEN reserves are initialized, THE Deployment System SHALL call the PoolConfigurator to add WXDC as a reserve with appropriate parameters
5. WHEN reserve configuration is complete, THE Deployment System SHALL enable borrowing and collateral usage for configured assets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to set appropriate protocol parameters for XDC Network, so that the protocol operates efficiently within network constraints

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring interest rate strategies, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy contracts with XDC-appropriate parameters
2. WHEN setting reserve parameters, THE Deployment System SHALL configure loan-to-value ratios, liquidation thresholds, and liquidation bonuses
3. WHEN configuring protocol fees, THE Deployment System SHALL set reserve factors and protocol fee percentages
4. WHEN access control is required, THE Deployment System SHALL deploy and configure the ACLManager contract with appropriate admin roles

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want to create deployment scripts and documentation, so that the deployment process is repeatable and maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated, THE Deployment System SHALL execute a deployment script that orchestrates all contract deployments in the correct order
2. WHEN deployment completes, THE Deployment System SHALL output a summary of all deployed contract addresses
3. WHEN deployment completes, THE Deployment System SHALL save deployment artifacts including contract addresses and ABIs
4. THE Deployment System SHALL provide clear error messages with resolution steps when deployment failures occur
5. WHEN documentation is generated, THE Deployment System SHALL include instructions for verifying contracts on XDC Network block explorers
